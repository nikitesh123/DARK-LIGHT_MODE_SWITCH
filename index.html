        <p>Being surrounded by natural beauty can lower stress levels, reduce anxiety, and improve overall well-being.</p>
        <p>Nature holds a balance between diverse ecosystems for smooth functioning. It consists of air, water, plants, animals, human life, and many more. Nature provides us with water to drink, air to breathe, food to eat, clothes to wear, and a shelter to live in. Imbalance in nature can be life-threatening to all.</p>
